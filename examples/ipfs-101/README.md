## About The Project

`js-ipfs@0.63` switched from [CJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) to [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) which means you can no longer `require` IPFS, you have to use `import` instead - please see the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/upgrading/v0.62-v0.63.md?rgh-link-date=2022-11-22T18%3A12%3A34Z#esm) for more information.

If your project is ESM you are using `import` already, but if it's CJS (or TypeScript that compiles to CJS) you have to use the [dynamic import function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import).

This example is a copy of [ipfs-101](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/js-ipfs-101) that shows how to use the dynamic import function from a CJS runtime.

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [IPFS Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Join the [Weekly Core Implementations Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992)** it's where everyone discusses what's going on with IPFS and what's next
