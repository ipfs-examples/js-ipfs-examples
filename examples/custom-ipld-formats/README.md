## About The Project

- Read the [docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs)
- Look into other [examples](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples) to learn how to spawn an IPFS node in Node.js and in the Browser
- Consult the [Core API docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs/core-api) to see what you can do with an IPFS node
- Visit https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io to learn about IPFS and the concepts that underpin it
- Head over to https://proto.school to take interactive tutorials that cover core IPFS APIs
- Check out https://docs.ipfs.io for tips, how-tos and more
- See https://blog.ipfs.io for news and more
- Need help? Please ask 'How do I?' questions on https://discuss.ipfs.io

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm start
```

## Usage

This example shows you how to configure an IPFS daemon with the ability to load extra IPLD formats so you can use them in your applications.

### Play with the configuration!

By default, IPFS is only configured to support a few common IPLD formats. Your application may require extra or more esoteric formats, in which case you can configure your node to support them using `options.ipld.formats` passed to the client or an in-process node or even a daemon if you start it with a wrapper.

See the following files for different configuration:

- [./in-process-node.js](./in-process-node.js) for running an in-process node as part of your configuration
- [./daemon-node.js](./daemon-node.js) for running a node as a separate daemon process

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](#documentation)_

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [IPFS Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Join the [Weekly Core Implementations Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992)** it's where everyone discusses what's going on with IPFS and what's next
