## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm start
```

## Usage

IPLD stands for [`InterPlanetary Linked-Data`](https://ipld.io/), it is the data model of the content-addressable web. It gives IPFS the ability to resolve through any kind of content-addressed graph, as long as the [adapter for the format is available](https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format#modules-that-implement-the-interface).

This tutorial goes through several operations over IPLD graphs using the [DAG API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/interface-ipfs-core/API/dag).

### IPLD Formats

[IPLD](https://docs.ipld.io/) can read many datatypes, all of which are represented as blocks in the blockstore of your IPFS node. In order to turn a block into a data structure it can use, IPLD uses different codecs to turn `Uint8Arrays` into JavaScript objects and back.

By default IPFS is bundled with [dag-pb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-dag-pb), [dag-cbor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-dag-cbor) and [raw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-raw) codecs which allow reading UnixFS files and JavaScript objects from the blockstore.

To configure other types, we must pass the `ipld.formats` option to the `IPFS.create()` function:

```javascript
const IPFS = require("ipfs");

const node = await IPFS.create({
  ipld: {
    formats: [
      require("ipld-git"),
      require("ipld-zcash"),
      require("ipld-bitcoin"),
      ...Object.values(require("ipld-ethereum")), // this format exports multiple codecs so flatten into a list
      // etc, etc
    ],
  },
});
```

See [ipld/interface-ipld-format](https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format) for a list of modules that implement the `ipld-format` interface.

### [create nodes to build a graph](./put.js)

### [retrieve a node from a graph](./get.js)

### [resolve a path in a graph](./get-path.js)

### [resolve through graphs of different kind](./get-path-accross-formats.js)

## [traverse through a slice of the ethereum blockchain](./eth.js)

## [traverse through a git repo](./git.js)

The example objects contained in "git-objects" have already been decompressed with zlib. An example of how to do this:

    $ cat .git/objects/7d/df25817f57c2090a9568cdb17106a76dad7d04 | zlib-flate -uncompress > 7ddf25817f57c2090a9568cdb17106a76dad7d04

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [IPFS Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Join the [Weekly Core Implementations Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992)** it's where everyone discusses what's going on with IPFS and what's next
