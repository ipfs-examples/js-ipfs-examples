## About The Project

- Read the [docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs)
- Look into other [examples](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples) to learn how to spawn an IPFS node in Node.js and in the Browser
- Consult the [Core API docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/docs/core-api) to see what you can do with an IPFS node
- Visit https://dweb-primer.ipfs.io to learn about IPFS and the concepts that underpin it
- Head over to https://proto.school to take interactive tutorials that cover core IPFS APIs
- Check out https://docs.ipfs.io for tips, how-tos and more
- See https://blog.ipfs.io for news and more
- Need help? Please ask 'How do I?' questions on https://discuss.ipfs.io

## Getting Started

### Pre requisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installation and Running example

```console
> npm install
> npm start
```

Now open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts from create-react-app

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed! Read how to host a [single page](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website/) or an [entire website](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/multipage-website/#prerequisites) on IPFS.

But with modern hosting services like Heroku, Netlity or Fleek, you can skip the build because they will do a complete github deployment for you. See the React official page about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Usage

A minimal demonstration of how to use js-ipfs in a `create-react-app` generated app.

All React applications store their main logic in `App.js`:

- `App.js` renders the cosmetics of the demo and call `useIpfs` to retrieve the `id` of the node
- `useIpfsFactory.js` initialises and closes the IPFS local node
- `useIpfs.js` does the actual calls to IPFS to retrieve the property specified in argument (here the retrieved property is `id`, requested from `App.js`)

Once the IPFS node is set up, `App.js` displays its ident and its version number.

> _Remember that a Peer ID of an IPFS node is [the multihash of the public key of this node](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md#peer-ids), and the public-private key pair of a node is generated by typing `ipfs init`._

![Screen shot of the js ipfs node id info](./images/screenshot.png)

**Note**: this example is useful to learn how to spawn IPFS from a web page. It is also possible to [spawn an IPFS daemon from the command line](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/command-line/) with `ipfs daemon`. While self-hosting is advised, one can also delegate IPFS operations to a third-party like Infura. See tutorials [here](https://blog.infura.io/part-2-getting-started-with-ipfs-on-infura/) and [here](https://blog.infura.io/part-2-getting-started-with-ipfs-on-infura/).

The IPFS implementation in JavaScript needs your help! There are a few things you can do right now to help out:

Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [JavaScript Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md).

- **Check out existing issues** The [issue list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues) has many that are marked as ['help wanted'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or ['difficulty:easy'](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy) which make great starting points for development, many of which can be tackled with no prior IPFS knowledge
- **Look at the [IPFS Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap)** This are the high priority items being worked on right now
- **Perform code reviews** More eyes will help
  a. speed the project along
  b. ensure quality, and
  c. reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Join the [Weekly Core Implementations Call](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992)** it's where everyone discusses what's going on with IPFS and what's next
